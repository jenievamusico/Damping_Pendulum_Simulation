# This project uses MATLAB to simulate the oscillation of a pendulum considering friction using analytical and numerical methods.
# The scripts are used to develop displacement and velocity analyses using both the Runge-Kutta 4th-order method as well as a numerical method of solving the second order ODE.
# The results of the simulation are displacement and velocity graphs of the pendulum over time due to damping effects.
